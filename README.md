============

Examples that I used for the PyGrunn July edition talk about Polymer.

Run the examples
----------------

From the top directory run

```bash
bower install
```

which will create a bower_components folder with all the required dependencies
in the examples directory. From the examples directory run a python server,
assuming that python is available in your system.

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000
```
