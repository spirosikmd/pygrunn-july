============

Examples that I used for the PyGrunn July edition talk about Polymer.

Run the examples
----------------

From the top directory run

```bash
bower install
```

to install all the required dependencies. From the example directory run a
python server, assuming that python is available in your system.

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000
```
